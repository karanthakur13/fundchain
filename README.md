## FundChain

### Introduction

Welcome to the Crowdfunding Application based on the Sepolia-Ethereum chain. This decentralized application (dApp) allows users to create fundraising campaigns, donate to ongoing campaigns, volunteer to help with campaigns, and track campaign details in real-time. The application utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for transparency, security, and immutability.

### Features

1. **Create Campaigns:** Users can create fundraising campaigns by providing essential details such as title, category, description, target amount, deadline, and an image to represent the campaign.

2. **View Ongoing Campaigns:** Users can browse and view all ongoing campaigns on the platform. Each campaign will display its title, category, target amount, and the amount raised so far.

3. **View Hosted Campaigns:** Users can view campaigns hosted by them on a separate dashboard. This dashboard will show all the campaigns they have created.

4. **Donate to Campaigns:** Users can contribute to any campaign by donating Ether (ETH). The donated amount will be added to the campaign's total funds raised.

5. **Volunteer for Campaigns:** Users can volunteer to help with a specific campaign by providing their name. The campaign owner can see the list of volunteers.

6. **Live Count of Donors and Volunteers:** Each campaign page will display a live count of the number of donors and volunteers who have participated in the campaign.

7. **View Donors and Volunteers:** Users can access a specific campaign page to view the list of donors and volunteers who have contributed to the campaign.
